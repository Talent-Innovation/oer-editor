# User Interface (UI) Concept

This folder will contain UI/UX resources for the OER Editor.

## Purpose
The goal of this directory is to provide designers, developers and contributors with:
- **Wireframes and mockups** of the editor (outline → lesson → quiz workflow).
- **Design guidelines**: typography, colors, accessibility considerations (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- **Component overview**: forms, buttons, preview windows.

## Current Status
We are starting with a **high-level concept** only (no code yet).  
Example components will be added as Figma/PNG/SVG exports in this folder.

## Future Plans
- Provide interactive Figma links for contributors.
- Add reusable React components once the editor development starts.
- Include screenshots and accessibility check results (AXE reports).
