# Examples

This folder contains sample outputs of the OER Editor, to help developers, teachers and reviewers understand the structure of generated content.

## Files

- **sample-course.json** – example of a generated course (outline → lessons → quizzes).
- Future examples may include:
  - xAPI statements captured during course playback
  - SCORM package structure (zipped)
  - Accessibility audit reports (AXE output)

## How to Use

1. Download `sample-course.json`.
2. Open it in any JSON viewer or import it into the OER Editor (once available).
3. You can edit, extend or localize it – then export to SCORM/xAPI format.
